      <h2>What is a Candlestick Chart?</h2>
      <p>
        A candlestick chart is a type of financial chart used to represent the price movement of an asset over a specific time period.
        Each "candlestick" typically represents one day of trading data and consists of a rectangular "body" and two "wicks" or "tails" extending from the top and bottom of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body of the candlestick represents the opening and closing prices of the asset for that day. If the closing price is higher than the opening price, the body is usually filled or colored green, indicating a bullish (upward) movement.
        If the closing price is lower than the opening price, the body is usually empty or colored red, indicating a bearish (downward) movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wicks or tails represent the highest and lowest prices reached during the trading day, also known as the high and low prices.
        Candlestick charts are widely used by traders to analyze price trends and make informed decisions about buying or selling assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding candlestick patterns and their interpretations is an essential skill for anyone involved in trading financial markets.
